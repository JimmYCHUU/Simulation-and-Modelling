#This repository contains implementations of key concepts in simulation and modeling, focusing on numerical computations, data visualization, and matrix operations using Python. The tasks include:<br/>

Tasks:<br/>
✅ Generate two vectors with 15 random floats each, plot them on the same graph, label the axes, and add a title.<br/>
✅ Create a 4×4 matrix with random values, visualize it as a heatmap, and label the rows and columns.<br/>
✅ Generate two 4×4 matrices, perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualize the results using bar plots, and analyze the effects.<br/>

**Concepts Covered:**<br/>
Random number generation<br/>
Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn<br/>
Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)<br/>
Heatmaps and bar plots for data representation<br/>
**What I Learned:**<br/>
